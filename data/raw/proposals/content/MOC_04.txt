Abstract

The proposed research focuses on the **development of an economically viable technology for the reclamation of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)** in the North Eastern (NE) coalfields, where extensive mining activities have resulted in severe environmental degradation due to the oxidation of sulfide minerals. AMD, characterized by low pH and elevated concentrations of iron, manganese, and sulfate, poses a major threat to aquatic ecosystems, soil fertility, and regional water quality. Current remediation techniques—such as lime neutralization, constructed wetlands, and passive bioreactors—often suffer from high operational costs and limited adaptability to the complex geochemical and hydrological conditions prevalent in NE India. This project proposes a novel hybrid reclamation system integrating **low-cost mineral adsorbents, biologically mediated sulfate reduction, and modular robotic process control** to enable sustainable, field-deployable AMD treatment. The research will involve geochemical characterization of AMD sources, optimization of treatment parameters, and development of an autonomous monitoring unit for continuous operation. Emphasis will be placed on material reusability, byproduct recovery, and energy efficiency to ensure economic feasibility. The expected outcome is a scalable reclamation technology that mitigates AMD impacts while supporting resource circularity and environmental compliance in mining operations, aligning with the principles of green mining and sustainable mineral resource management.



1. Introduction & Background

The North Eastern coalfields of India, particularly in Assam and Meghalaya, are characterized by extensive deposits of high-sulfur sub-bituminous and tertiary coals. Uncontrolled mining and exposure of pyritic formations have led to persistent **Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)**, a phenomenon arising from the oxidation of sulfide minerals (mainly pyrite, FeS₂) in the presence of oxygen and water, producing sulfuric acid and dissolved metal ions. The resulting acidic effluents significantly lower the pH of receiving streams, mobilize heavy metals, and degrade local ecosystems. Traditional remediation approaches such as lime neutralization, active aeration, and settling ponds provide partial treatment but entail substantial chemical and maintenance costs, making them unsuitable for remote and economically constrained mining regions. Moreover, the unique climatic and geological conditions of the NE coalfields—marked by high rainfall, steep terrain, and dispersed mining sites—demand adaptive, low-maintenance, and modular treatment technologies. Recent advances in **biogeochemical engineering** and **autonomous process control** offer promising pathways to address these challenges. By integrating biological sulfate-reducing processes with engineered adsorbent systems and automated control architectures, it is possible to develop an economically sustainable and environmentally resilient solution for AMD mitigation. This project thus seeks to bridge the gap between laboratory-scale remediation techniques and field-scale deployment, ensuring the long-term ecological recovery of the NE coalfield region.



2. Proposed Methodology

The proposed R&D project will employ an integrated, multi-phase approach encompassing **site characterization, process development, system integration, and pilot-scale validation**. Initially, comprehensive sampling and geochemical analysis of AMD sources will be conducted to determine acidity, sulfate concentration, metal load, and microbial community structure. Based on this data, a hybrid treatment model will be designed combining three primary components: **(i)** mineral-based adsorption using locally available lateritic or clay minerals for metal sequestration, **(ii)** biologically driven sulfate reduction using mixed microbial consortia in an anaerobic bioreactor, and **(iii)** automated process regulation utilizing low-cost robotic sensors and feedback control algorithms to maintain optimal redox and pH conditions. The reactor design will incorporate modular treatment cells allowing scalability and ease of maintenance. The system will operate in semi-passive mode to minimize energy requirements, with effluent recycling for enhanced retention time. Advanced characterization techniques such as ICP-OES, XRD, and SEM-EDS will be employed to evaluate metal removal efficiency and material stability. Economic modeling and life-cycle assessment will be integrated to quantify cost-benefit ratios and environmental impact. Finally, a pilot-scale demonstration unit will be installed at a representative AMD-affected site in the NE coalfields to evaluate field performance, reliability, and long-term sustainability under variable climatic conditions.



Expected Outcomes & Conclusion

The expected outcome of the project is the development of a **cost-effective, sustainable, and field-deployable reclamation technology** for the treatment of Acid Mine Drainage in the NE coalfields. The integrated system is anticipated to achieve pH neutralization within the range of 6.5–8.0, with more than 90% removal efficiency for key heavy metals such as Fe, Mn, and Al, while maintaining low operational and maintenance costs. The inclusion of biologically mediated sulfate reduction will minimize reagent consumption, whereas the use of indigenous mineral adsorbents will ensure economic feasibility and local material utilization. The autonomous robotic control subsystem will enable continuous, real-time monitoring and adaptive regulation of process parameters, reducing dependency on skilled labor in remote locations. In addition to environmental restoration, the process may facilitate recovery of secondary resources such as metal precipitates, potentially adding economic value. The technology will serve as a model for **green mining practices** in India, contributing to compliance with environmental regulations and improving the socio-ecological resilience of mining communities. Ultimately, the research will yield both scientific and practical advancements in the field of mining environmental engineering, supporting the transition toward **sustainable and intelligent mine water management systems** for long-term ecological reclamation.
