Abstract

The proposed research focuses on the development of a solar-powered, adsorption-based integrated system for simultaneous cooling and water recovery from mine air, aiming to address critical challenges of thermal management and water scarcity in mining operations. Underground and surface mines often encounter high-temperature, low-humidity environments where conventional cooling methods are energy-intensive and water use is inefficient. The proposed system leverages adsorption refrigeration technology coupled with advanced hygroscopic materials to extract latent and sensible heat from mine air while simultaneously condensing water vapor for recovery. Solar thermal energy will be harnessed to drive the adsorption cycles, minimizing dependence on grid electricity and enabling sustainable operation in remote mine sites. The research will focus on the design and optimization of adsorbent materials, heat and mass transfer enhancement techniques, and integration of a modular system suitable for mine ventilation networks. Computational modeling of adsorption kinetics, thermodynamic performance, and airflow dynamics will guide the system design, while prototype experimentation will validate cooling capacity and water recovery efficiency under realistic mine conditions. This innovation aims to provide a dual-purpose solution that enhances occupational safety, improves energy efficiency, and contributes to water conservation in mining environments, aligning with the principles of sustainable and smart mining.

1. Introduction & Background

Mining operations are increasingly challenged by elevated temperatures and limited water availability, particularly in deep underground coal and metal mines. High air temperatures and heat stress affect worker productivity, equipment efficiency, and safety, while conventional mechanical cooling and water supply systems often impose significant energy burdens and operational costs. Simultaneously, mine air contains recoverable water vapor, representing an underutilized resource that could alleviate freshwater demand in arid or remote mining regions. Adsorption-based cooling and dehumidification technologies have emerged as promising alternatives due to their low-grade heat utilization, high reliability, and environmental friendliness. Solar-driven adsorption systems, in particular, offer the advantage of harnessing renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions and operational costs. Prior research has demonstrated the feasibility of adsorption cycles using silica gel, zeolites, and metal-organic frameworks for air dehumidification and cooling; however, challenges remain in scaling the technology for continuous operation in variable mine airflow conditions, optimizing heat and mass transfer, and integrating water recovery with cooling functions. This project proposes an integrated system that combines solar thermal energy input, advanced adsorbent materials, and modular airflow design to enable continuous cooling and water recovery from mine air, contributing to improved mine climate control, water sustainability, and energy efficiency.

2. Proposed Methodology

The research methodology involves four interconnected phases: (i) mine air characterization and system design, (ii) adsorbent material selection and optimization, (iii) system integration and modeling, and (iv) prototype development and field testing.
Initially, comprehensive monitoring of mine air will be conducted to quantify temperature, humidity, airflow rates, and contaminant levels. This data will inform the design of an adsorption bed configuration, airflow paths, and heat exchanger geometry. The second phase will focus on selecting and synthesizing high-capacity, thermally stable adsorbents such as zeolites, silica gels, or metal-organic frameworks, with surface modifications to enhance water uptake and desorption kinetics. Heat and mass transfer enhancement techniques, including structured packing and thin-film adsorption, will be evaluated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. In the third phase, a system-level thermodynamic model will be developed to optimize the coupling of the solar thermal collector, adsorption cooling cycle, and water recovery condenser, evaluating performance metrics such as coefficient of performance (COP), cooling power, and water yield. The final phase involves constructing a modular pilot-scale prototype suitable for mine ventilation ducts, integrating solar collectors, adsorption beds, and condensers with real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and water output. Performance testing under controlled and field conditions will assess energy efficiency, operational reliability, and water recovery rates, with iterative design improvements implemented based on experimental results.

3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion

The expected outcomes of this project include the development of a fully functional solar-powered adsorption system capable of providing simultaneous cooling and water recovery from mine air. The system is projected to achieve a coefficient of performance exceeding 0.5 and water recovery rates sufficient to supply non-potable mine operations such as dust suppression and equipment cooling. The modular design will enable scalable deployment across underground tunnels and surface ventilation networks, while the integration of solar thermal energy ensures sustainable operation with minimal grid dependence. From a technical perspective, the research will yield optimized adsorbent materials with high water uptake and durability, validated CFD-based airflow designs, and comprehensive performance models for adsorption-based climate control. Environmentally, the system will reduce energy consumption, water wastage, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with conventional cooling and water supply methods. Operationally, it will improve worker comfort and safety by maintaining lower tunnel temperatures and humidity, while simultaneously providing a renewable source of recovered water. In conclusion, this project represents a novel, dual-purpose technological solution that aligns with smart mining initiatives, resource efficiency goals, and the sustainable development of energy-intensive underground and surface mining operations.
