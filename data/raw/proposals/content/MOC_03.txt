Abstract

The proposed research aims to develop a **web-based repository of coal mines** that integrates geospatial, geological, operational, and environmental datasets into a unified digital platform accessible through a secure, interactive web interface. The repository will serve as a centralized data management and visualization system to support decision-making, research, and regulatory oversight within the mining industry. Current coal mine data systems are fragmented across multiple agencies and exist in heterogeneous formats, resulting in inefficiencies in data retrieval, validation, and analysis. The proposed platform will address these challenges by employing modern web technologies, spatial database architectures, and data interoperability standards. Key components will include a relational database backend, GIS-based visualization tools, metadata management, and analytics dashboards. Advanced features such as mine hazard mapping, production tracking, and environmental compliance monitoring will be embedded to enhance usability. The repository will also incorporate machine learning-based data validation and automated report generation modules. By providing real-time access to structured and spatially indexed data, the system will enable more efficient mine planning, risk assessment, and policy formulation. This initiative represents a significant advancement in the digital transformation of the coal mining sector, aligning with the broader objectives of sustainable resource management and Industry 4.0 integration.



1. Introduction & Background

Coal mining remains a critical component of the global energy sector, yet effective management of mining information continues to be a persistent challenge. Data related to coal mine operations—including geological surveys, production records, safety reports, and environmental compliance documents—are typically maintained in siloed systems across different departments and organizations. This lack of centralization impedes data-driven decision-making, leading to inefficiencies in resource planning, safety monitoring, and regulatory enforcement. The increasing complexity of modern mining operations, coupled with the need for transparency and sustainability, underscores the importance of an integrated digital repository. Recent advancements in web-based technologies, cloud computing, and geospatial information systems (GIS) have enabled the creation of interactive, large-scale databases capable of managing multidimensional mining data. Several international mining authorities have initiated digital repositories; however, most lack dynamic analytics capabilities and fail to provide interoperability across data sources. This project addresses these limitations by developing a comprehensive, web-based repository specifically designed for coal mines. The platform will aggregate and standardize data from multiple sources, ensuring accessibility, accuracy, and analytical capability. It will function not merely as a database but as an intelligent decision-support system that bridges the gap between operational data, regulatory compliance, and strategic resource management within the coal mining industry.



2. Proposed Methodology

The development of the web-based coal mine repository will be executed in four systematic phases: **(i)** data collection and preprocessing, **(ii)** database design and architecture, **(iii)** web application development, and **(iv)** deployment and testing. Initially, data will be sourced from geological surveys, mine production databases, safety audit reports, and environmental monitoring systems. Preprocessing will involve data cleaning, normalization, and georeferencing to ensure compatibility across datasets. A hybrid database structure will be designed—combining a relational SQL database for structured data and a NoSQL geospatial database (e.g., MongoDB with GeoJSON extensions) for spatial data. The backend will be developed using frameworks such as Django or Flask, while the frontend interface will employ React or Angular for real-time interactivity. Integration with GIS APIs will enable visualization of mine locations, coal seam boundaries, and hazard zones on dynamic maps. Advanced features such as spatial querying, data analytics dashboards, and machine learning-based predictive modules for risk assessment will be incorporated. The system will adhere to web interoperability standards (OGC and ISO 19115) and employ secure authentication protocols for user access management. Performance testing, scalability evaluation, and validation through field data will be conducted prior to deployment on a cloud-based infrastructure to ensure reliability, accessibility, and data integrity.



3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion

The completion of this project will result in a fully functional **web-based repository of coal mines** that consolidates diverse datasets into a single, user-friendly, and intelligent platform. The system will enable real-time visualization and analysis of coal mine attributes, including production trends, geological structures, and safety or environmental indicators. Expected technical outcomes include the development of an interoperable geospatial database, an automated data ingestion pipeline, and an AI-assisted validation framework for continuous data integrity monitoring. From an operational standpoint, the repository will improve the efficiency of mine planning, regulatory reporting, and environmental impact assessment by providing stakeholders—such as mining companies, government agencies, and researchers—with direct access to reliable and updated data. The platform will support policy formulation and compliance auditing by generating customized analytics reports and predictive insights. Moreover, the project contributes to the digital transformation of the mining sector by promoting transparency, traceability, and data-driven governance. In conclusion, the web-based repository will serve as a national-level digital infrastructure for coal mine information management, fostering safer, more sustainable, and technologically advanced mining operations in alignment with global trends toward smart and responsible resource exploitation.
