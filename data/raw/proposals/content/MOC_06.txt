Abstract

The proposed research aims to develop an innovative and economically viable technology for the recovery of coking coal from washery rejects, with the objective of minimizing resource wastage and enhancing the overall efficiency of coal utilization. Coal washeries generate large quantities of rejects containing substantial amounts of fine coking coal that remain unrecovered due to the inefficiencies of conventional beneficiation methods. These rejects not only represent a significant loss of valuable carbonaceous material but also contribute to environmental degradation through large-scale disposal in slurry ponds and dumps. The proposed study will focus on the design and optimization of a hybrid physical–chemical beneficiation process integrating advanced froth flotation, enhanced gravity separation, and surface chemistry modification. The research will incorporate characterization of washery rejects using advanced analytical techniques to determine particle size distribution, mineral association, and surface hydrophobicity. Machine learning-assisted process optimization will be employed to maximize recovery efficiency under varying feed characteristics. The final goal is to develop a modular, scalable system suitable for deployment in Indian coking coal washeries, ensuring both technical feasibility and economic sustainability. The project aligns with the strategic objectives of sustainable mining and resource conservation, contributing significantly to India’s metallurgical coal security and reducing the ecological footprint of coal washing operations.

1. Introduction & Background

Coking coal is a critical input for steelmaking, and its demand continues to rise with industrial growth and infrastructure development. However, India’s coking coal reserves are limited and often characterized by high ash content, necessitating beneficiation prior to metallurgical use. During coal washing operations, significant quantities of fine coal particles are lost in washery rejects, which typically contain 25–40% combustible matter. These rejects are usually disposed of in tailings ponds or dumps, creating severe environmental hazards such as spontaneous combustion, acid mine drainage, and land degradation. Conventional recovery processes like froth flotation and spiral concentrators are limited by inefficient fine particle separation, poor selectivity, and high reagent consumption. Recent advancements in fine coal beneficiation—including the use of enhanced gravity separators, column flotation, and chemical surface modification—have shown potential for improving recovery from ultra-fine fractions. Nevertheless, these technologies require adaptation to Indian coal characteristics, which are known for high clay content and complex mineralogical associations. This project seeks to develop an integrated technological framework that leverages advanced separation science, process automation, and machine learning-based optimization for efficient recovery of coking coal from washery rejects. The outcome will address both economic and environmental imperatives by transforming waste into a valuable secondary resource and promoting sustainable coal processing practices.

2. Proposed Methodology

The proposed R&D work will follow a multi-phase approach involving characterization, process development, optimization, and pilot-scale validation. Initially, representative washery reject samples will be collected from major Indian coking coal washeries. Comprehensive characterization will be conducted using proximate and ultimate analyses, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS), and float-sink studies to understand mineralogical associations and liberation characteristics. Based on the results, a process flow sheet will be designed integrating selective comminution, advanced froth flotation, and enhanced gravity separation techniques such as the Falcon concentrator or Knelson separator. Surface modification using surfactants and polymeric reagents will be explored to improve hydrophobic–hydrophilic selectivity for fine particle recovery. A data-driven optimization framework employing machine learning algorithms—such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and genetic algorithms—will be used to identify optimal operating parameters including reagent dosage, particle size distribution, and hydrodynamic conditions. The process performance will be evaluated in terms of recovery yield, ash reduction, and energy consumption. A techno-economic analysis will be carried out to assess scalability and cost-effectiveness. The final stage will involve pilot-scale implementation using a semi-continuous beneficiation unit integrated with automated process monitoring and control systems to validate the developed technology under real washery operating conditions.

3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion

The proposed project is expected to result in the development of an optimized, scalable, and eco-efficient technology for the recovery of coking coal from washery rejects. The integrated beneficiation process is projected to achieve a combustible recovery exceeding 70% with a reduction of ash content to below 17%, making the recovered product suitable for metallurgical applications. The technology will offer significant environmental benefits by reducing the volume of washery rejects requiring disposal, thus mitigating associated land and water pollution. The incorporation of surface chemistry modification and data-driven optimization will enhance process adaptability across different coal types and washery configurations. From an industrial perspective, the developed system will improve resource utilization efficiency and contribute to the self-reliance of the steel sector by augmenting domestic coking coal supplies. Furthermore, the pilot-scale demonstration will provide a foundation for commercial-scale deployment and technology transfer. Beyond its immediate applications, the research will advance scientific understanding in fine coal beneficiation, hydrodynamic modeling, and process automation. In conclusion, the successful execution of this project will represent a significant step toward sustainable coal processing, transforming waste streams into value-added resources and supporting the broader objectives of circular economy and environmental stewardship in the mining industry.
