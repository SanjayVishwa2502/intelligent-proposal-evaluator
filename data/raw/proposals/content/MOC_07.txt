Abstract

The proposed research aims to develop an integrated drone and sensor-based methodology for the monitoring of slope stability and mine dump management, addressing one of the most critical challenges in surface mining operations. Slope failures and dump instabilities represent significant geotechnical hazards, often resulting in catastrophic economic and environmental consequences. Traditional slope monitoring systems rely on point-based measurements, limited spatial coverage, and manual inspection, which are inadequate for real-time, large-scale surveillance. This project proposes a hybrid framework combining Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, LiDAR mapping, ground-based sensor networks, and machine learning-based predictive analytics to enable continuous, high-resolution monitoring of slopes and waste dumps. The UAVs will acquire topographical and thermal imagery, while ground sensors such as inclinometers, extensometers, and piezometers will capture subsurface deformation and pore pressure data. These datasets will be fused through a geospatial data integration platform and analyzed using advanced algorithms to identify precursory deformation patterns indicative of instability. The research will culminate in the design of an automated early warning and decision-support system for mine operators. The project’s outcomes will enhance slope hazard forecasting accuracy, reduce risk to personnel and equipment, and promote safer and more sustainable surface mining practices.

1. Introduction & Background

Slope and dump stability are key determinants of safety and productivity in open-cast mining operations. Failures in these structures often result from complex interactions between geological discontinuities, water infiltration, blasting vibrations, and progressive deformation. Traditional stability monitoring methods—such as total station surveys, borehole inclinometers, and visual inspections—are spatially limited, labor-intensive, and lack the temporal resolution required for real-time hazard detection. Recent advancements in robotics, remote sensing, and geotechnical instrumentation have introduced new possibilities for autonomous, data-driven slope monitoring systems. UAVs equipped with high-resolution cameras and LiDAR sensors can generate detailed 3D surface models, enabling precise detection of micro-topographic changes over time. Concurrently, ground-based sensors can continuously record geotechnical parameters, providing complementary subsurface information. Integrating these multi-source datasets using artificial intelligence and geospatial analytics allows for early detection of instability mechanisms and predictive modeling of potential failure zones. Despite such technological potential, existing systems lack full automation, sensor fusion capabilities, and field adaptability under variable mining conditions. This project addresses these limitations by developing a comprehensive drone-sensor hybrid framework for continuous monitoring and predictive assessment of slope and dump stability, advancing current geotechnical monitoring practices toward intelligent and autonomous hazard management systems.

2. Proposed Methodology

The project methodology is structured into four major phases: (i) data acquisition and instrumentation, (ii) data integration and modeling, (iii) predictive analysis and visualization, and (iv) field validation and system optimization.
In the first phase, UAVs equipped with LiDAR, RGB, and multispectral cameras will be deployed to capture high-resolution imagery and topographic point clouds over slope and dump areas. Simultaneously, ground-based geotechnical sensors—such as inclinometers, extensometers, piezometers, and ground vibration sensors—will be installed to record deformation, pore pressure, and dynamic response data. In the second phase, the acquired datasets will be spatially registered within a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework, and a digital elevation model (DEM) will be generated to detect temporal surface changes through differential analysis. Machine learning algorithms, including random forest classifiers and deep neural networks, will be developed to identify instability precursors by correlating sensor data with geospatial deformation patterns. Predictive models will be trained using historical failure data and continuously updated through adaptive learning mechanisms. The third phase will focus on integrating predictive outputs into an automated visualization and alerting dashboard using web-based interfaces. Finally, pilot testing will be conducted at an operational mine site to validate model accuracy, sensor performance, and communication reliability, with optimization focusing on energy efficiency, data latency reduction, and system robustness under field conditions.

3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion

The anticipated outcome of this research is a fully integrated, drone- and sensor-based system for real-time monitoring and prediction of slope and dump stability in surface mining environments. The system will deliver multi-dimensional insights by combining aerial photogrammetry, LiDAR mapping, and in-situ geotechnical data into a unified decision-support framework. It is expected to achieve high spatial resolution (centimeter-scale) and temporal continuity (sub-hourly updates), enabling early detection of deformation trends and identification of potential failure zones. The machine learning algorithms will enhance prediction accuracy, reducing false alarms and allowing for reliable early warning generation. Quantitatively, the developed system aims to improve slope stability assessment accuracy by 25–30% compared to conventional methods. The technology will contribute to improved mine safety, reduced operational downtime, and more efficient waste dump management. Furthermore, it will promote the implementation of autonomous monitoring practices in line with the principles of Mining 4.0, fostering a shift from reactive to proactive geotechnical risk management. In conclusion, the project represents a significant advancement toward intelligent, data-driven mine safety management, providing a scalable and replicable model for deployment across diverse geotechnical and mining environments worldwide.
