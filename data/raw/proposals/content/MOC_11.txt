Abstract

The proposed research aims to develop an efficient and cost-effective process for the removal of toxic heavy metals from acid mine drainage (AMD), addressing one of the most pressing environmental challenges in mining operations. AMD, generated by the oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals, is characterized by low pH and elevated concentrations of toxic metals such as Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd, which pose serious ecological and human health risks. Conventional treatment methods, including lime neutralization, chemical precipitation, and constructed wetlands, often suffer from high operational costs, sludge management challenges, and incomplete removal of trace metals. This project proposes a hybrid treatment approach combining low-cost adsorbent materials, such as biochar and industrial by-products, with advanced chemical and biological processes to enhance heavy metal sequestration. The research will involve systematic characterization of AMD effluents, optimization of adsorption and precipitation parameters, and evaluation of synergistic effects of combined treatment strategies. Additionally, process intensification through the integration of modular treatment units and real-time monitoring will be implemented to improve operational efficiency. The expected outcome is a scalable, economically viable treatment process that achieves high metal removal efficiency while minimizing secondary waste generation, contributing to sustainable water management and environmental compliance in mining regions.

1. Introduction & Background

Acid mine drainage is a critical environmental problem arising from the exposure of sulfide-rich mineral deposits to oxygen and water during mining activities. The resulting acidic effluent typically contains high concentrations of toxic heavy metals, which are highly soluble under low pH conditions and can contaminate surface and groundwater systems, negatively impacting aquatic ecosystems and human health. Traditional AMD treatment methods, including lime addition, neutralization ponds, and passive wetland systems, often involve significant chemical consumption, generate large volumes of metal-laden sludge, and are inadequate for achieving stringent regulatory limits for trace metals. Moreover, the heterogeneous composition of AMD, fluctuating flow rates, and variability in metal concentrations pose additional challenges to consistent treatment. Recent advances in adsorption-based technologies, using low-cost and high-surface-area materials, offer promising pathways for selective heavy metal removal. Biochar, industrial residues, and modified mineral adsorbents have demonstrated high affinity for toxic metals under acidic conditions, while synergistic integration with chemical precipitation and microbial remediation can enhance overall treatment efficiency. This project seeks to develop an integrated, cost-effective treatment process for AMD, combining adsorption, chemical, and biological methods to achieve comprehensive metal removal. The research will address key knowledge gaps related to adsorbent selection, process optimization, and scalability, providing a sustainable solution for the reclamation of AMD-impacted water resources in mining regions.

2. Proposed Methodology

The proposed methodology involves a multi-phase experimental and modeling approach encompassing characterization, treatment design, process optimization, and pilot-scale validation. Initially, representative AMD samples will be collected from diverse mining sites and analyzed for pH, redox potential, metal speciation, ionic strength, and organic/inorganic constituents using ICP-OES, AAS, and XRD techniques. The first treatment module will focus on adsorption-based metal removal, employing biochar, zeolites, and industrial by-products as adsorbents. Adsorbent surface modification using functional groups or nanoparticle impregnation will be explored to enhance selectivity and capacity. Batch and column studies will optimize key parameters including contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH adjustment, and temperature. The second module will integrate chemical precipitation and co-precipitation using cost-effective reagents such as lime or sodium hydroxide, aiming to target residual metals and enhance sludge dewaterability. Where feasible, microbial-assisted remediation using metal-tolerant sulfate-reducing bacteria will be employed to facilitate biogenic sulfide precipitation. A modular process flow sheet will be developed and simulated using mass and energy balances to predict system performance and optimize operational efficiency. Finally, a pilot-scale demonstration unit will be constructed to evaluate real-time metal removal efficiency, effluent quality, operational costs, and sludge generation under continuous flow conditions, ensuring the scalability and economic viability of the proposed treatment process.

3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion

The anticipated outcomes of this research include the development of a robust, efficient, and economically sustainable AMD treatment process capable of removing a broad spectrum of toxic heavy metals to meet or exceed environmental regulatory standards. The integrated adsorption–chemical–biological system is expected to achieve metal removal efficiencies exceeding 90% for major toxic ions such as Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Pb, while minimizing sludge production and chemical consumption. The use of low-cost adsorbents and industrial by-products will reduce operational costs, enabling deployment in economically constrained mining regions. Pilot-scale validation will demonstrate continuous operational stability, process scalability, and adaptability to variable AMD compositions. Beyond immediate water quality improvements, the project will provide critical insights into adsorbent selection, synergistic process integration, and real-time monitoring for heavy metal remediation. The successful implementation of this technology will promote sustainable mining practices, protect downstream aquatic ecosystems, and support regulatory compliance, while offering potential for resource recovery from captured metals. In conclusion, this project represents a strategic advancement in environmental engineering for the mining sector, combining cost-effectiveness, technical efficiency, and ecological stewardship in the management of acid mine drainage.
