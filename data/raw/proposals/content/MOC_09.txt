The proposed research aims to develop an integrated coal-to-specialty chemicals and fuel conversion technology, leveraging advanced thermochemical, catalytic, and process intensification techniques to enhance the value chain of coal utilization. With the growing global emphasis on energy diversification and sustainable industrial feedstocks, there is an urgent need to transition from conventional thermal coal combustion toward high-value product generation. Indian coals, characterized by high ash and variable sulfur content, present technical challenges for direct conversion processes; however, advances in catalytic gasification, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, and hydrocracking provide a pathway for efficient conversion into liquid fuels, olefins, and aromatic compounds. The proposed R&D initiative will focus on optimizing the conversion process through multi-stage gasification, catalytic upgrading, and syngas tailoring to produce target chemical intermediates such as methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), and light hydrocarbons. Computational modeling and pilot-scale experimentation will be employed to refine reaction kinetics, optimize catalyst composition, and evaluate process thermodynamics. Environmental considerations—including CO₂ capture, by-product valorization, and waste minimization—will be integrated into the design framework. The outcome will be a scalable, economically viable, and environmentally responsible technology for transforming low-grade coal into high-value specialty chemicals and fuels, contributing to national energy security and industrial self-reliance.

1. Introduction & Background

Coal remains a dominant energy resource in India, contributing significantly to power generation and industrial feedstock supply. However, its direct combustion for power generation is associated with high carbon emissions and suboptimal resource utilization. The emerging global energy paradigm emphasizes coal valorization—the conversion of coal into high-value chemicals and synthetic fuels—to maximize economic return while minimizing environmental impact. Specialty chemicals derived from coal, such as methanol, olefins, benzene-toluene-xylene (BTX) aromatics, and synthetic diesel, serve as essential precursors for polymers, pharmaceuticals, and advanced fuels. The key challenge lies in developing efficient and clean conversion routes that can handle the heterogeneity of Indian coal. Conventional gasification and liquefaction processes are capital-intensive and often constrained by inefficiencies in syngas composition control, catalyst deactivation, and high CO₂ generation. Recent advancements in plasma-assisted gasification, nano-catalytic hydroconversion, and modular process intensification present new opportunities for improving conversion yields and energy efficiency. Furthermore, coupling coal conversion with carbon capture and utilization (CCU) strategies can drastically reduce the environmental footprint. This project proposes a systematic research framework combining experimental investigation, computational modeling, and pilot-scale validation to develop a robust technology platform for converting indigenous coal into specialty chemicals and clean fuels under economically viable and environmentally sustainable conditions.

2. Proposed Methodology

The proposed methodology is structured into four interconnected phases: (i) feedstock characterization, (ii) process development, (iii) catalytic optimization, and (iv) pilot-scale validation.
In the first phase, detailed physico-chemical characterization of representative Indian coals will be performed using proximate, ultimate, and petrographic analyses to establish correlations between feed properties and conversion behavior. In the second phase, a multi-stage thermochemical process will be designed combining plasma-assisted gasification for enhanced syngas generation with catalytic reforming for adjusting the H₂/CO ratio suitable for downstream synthesis. The third phase will focus on catalyst design and optimization. Nano-engineered catalysts based on transition metal oxides, zeolites, and supported ruthenium or cobalt systems will be synthesized to promote selective conversion to methanol, dimethyl ether, or light hydrocarbons. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and process simulation tools such as Aspen Plus will be used to model reactor performance, heat integration, and overall process efficiency. The final phase will involve the development of a modular bench-scale pilot reactor to validate process parameters and evaluate long-term catalyst stability. Environmental impact assessment and techno-economic analysis will be conducted concurrently to ensure that the proposed process achieves minimal emissions, efficient carbon utilization, and economic competitiveness compared to conventional petrochemical routes.

3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion

The expected outcome of this research is a technologically and economically viable coal-to-specialty-chemicals and fuel conversion process, capable of transforming low-grade Indian coals into high-value liquid and gaseous products. The process is projected to achieve conversion efficiencies exceeding 75% with substantial reduction in CO₂ emissions through integrated carbon capture and utilization. The development of advanced catalysts and optimized reaction pathways will enable the selective synthesis of target compounds such as methanol, DME, synthetic diesel, and BTX aromatics, expanding the domestic chemical production capacity. Furthermore, the research will establish critical design parameters for scaling up the technology to semi-commercial levels, providing a foundation for industrial implementation. From an environmental perspective, the technology will contribute to clean coal utilization, waste minimization, and improved lifecycle carbon efficiency. The broader impact includes enhancing India’s energy security, reducing import dependency on petrochemicals, and promoting sustainable utilization of indigenous coal resources. In conclusion, the project represents a strategic step toward realizing the vision of integrated coal valorization, bridging the gap between conventional energy systems and advanced chemical manufacturing in alignment with national initiatives for energy transition and industrial innovation.
