Traditional shovel buckets in surface mining operations operate under harsh conditions that induce significant wear, material loss, and inefficiencies in material handling. This project aims to develop an intelligent, sensor-embedded shovel bucket capable of real-time monitoring of digging forces, material characteristics, wear progression, and load distribution. Utilizing embedded strain gauges, inertial measurement units (IMUs), proximity sensors, and edge computing modules, the smart shovel bucket will facilitate adaptive control and predictive maintenance.

This development represents a significant advancement toward autonomous excavation systems, improving both operational productivity and environmental sustainability.\n\n\n\n1. Introduction & Background\n\nMining operations rely heavily on the efficiency and reliability of excavation equipment, particularly electric rope shovels and hydraulic excavators. The shovel bucket, as the primary interface between machinery and the material, directly influences productivity, fuel consumption, and equipment wear. However, conventional shovel buckets lack the capability to monitor their operational state or adapt to dynamic excavation environments. This results in suboptimal digging performance, premature wear, and unplanned maintenance downtime. Recent advances in mechatronics, robotics, and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) offer new opportunities to transform traditional mining equipment into intelligent cyber-physical systems. Smart excavation tools equipped with sensor networks and embedded computation have demonstrated potential in laboratory-scale prototypes, yet their deployment in large-scale mining contexts remains limited. The proposed research addresses this gap by developing a smart shovel bucket capable of acquiring, processing, and transmitting operational data in real time. This will enable active control of digging parameters and predictive maintenance scheduling. The integration of robotics and machine learning within mining systems represents a key step toward fully autonomous operations. By combining mechanical design optimization with embedded intelligence, the proposed system seeks to redefine the functionality and reliability of excavation interfaces in next-generation mining equipment.\n\n\n\n2. Proposed Methodology\n\nThe development of the smart shovel bucket will proceed through four primary stages: **(i)** system design and modeling, **(ii)** sensor integration and hardware development, **(iii)** algorithm design and control implementation, and **(iv)** experimental validation. The initial phase involves the mechanical design of a reinforced bucket structure using finite element analysis (FEA) to identify stress concentrations under variable load conditions. This will inform the optimal placement of sensors and the selection of materials with high wear resistance. The sensor suite will include strain gauges, load cells, vibration sensors, IMUs, and ultrasonic proximity sensors to capture forces, acceleration, material hardness, and bucket-fill dynamics.

Communication with the main control system will utilize wireless industrial protocols such as ZigBee or LoRaWAN. Machine learning algorithms, specifically regression models and reinforcement learning, will be employed to predict wear patterns and optimize digging parameters based on historical data. Control algorithms will enable semi-autonomous operation by adjusting digging angle, velocity, and penetration depth. Field tests will be conducted in controlled mining environments to validate performance under realistic operational loads, with metrics including energy efficiency, cycle time, and structural integrity monitored continuously.\n\n\n\n3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project include the successful development of a prototype smart shovel bucket that exhibits enhanced operational awareness, adaptive control capabilities, and predictive maintenance functionality. Quantitatively, the system is anticipated to improve excavation efficiency by 15\u201320%, reduce unplanned maintenance events by up to 30%, and extend bucket lifespan by approximately 25%.

        "full_text": "Abstract\n\nThe proposed research aims to develop an **artificial intelligence (AI)-based system for detecting fatality risks among Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) operators** in mining and large-scale earthwork environments. Accidents involving HEMM are among the leading causes of occupational fatalities in the mining industry, often resulting from human fatigue, inattentiveness, poor situational awareness, and environmental hazards. Current safety monitoring systems are reactive, relying on post-incident analysis rather than proactive prevention. This project proposes an integrated AI-driven framework that utilizes multimodal data\u2014such as physiological signals, visual monitoring, machine telemetry, and environmental parameters\u2014to assess real-time operator risk levels. The system will employ deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures, to recognize behavioral anomalies, fatigue signatures, and potential hazard precursors. The innovation lies in the fusion of human-centric sensing with machine intelligence to provide continuous, predictive safety analytics. The ultimate objective is to develop a robust, field-deployable prototype that can issue early warnings or automatic interventions to prevent fatalities. The research outcomes will significantly enhance occupational safety standards and contribute to the implementation of intelligent safety management systems in the mining industry.\n\n\n\n1. Introduction & Background\n\nHeavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) such as dump trucks, excavators, loaders, and bulldozers play a vital role in mechanized mining operations. However, their operation presents inherent risks due to large inertial masses, limited visibility, fatigue-prone long shifts, and dynamic working conditions. Studies indicate that a significant proportion of HEMM-related accidents are attributable to operator-related factors such as fatigue, distraction, microsleep, and misjudgment of operational boundaries. Traditional safety measures, including visual inspections, manual supervision, and alarm-based systems, are insufficient for real-time hazard mitigation. With the advent of artificial intelligence, advanced sensing technologies, and high-performance computing, there exists an opportunity to revolutionize occupational safety through predictive analytics. Recent research in AI-based human state monitoring\u2014encompassing facial recognition, eye tracking, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, and behavioral modeling\u2014has shown promise in detecting early indicators of operator distress. Yet, existing systems lack the contextual awareness required to interpret complex mining environments. Therefore, this project proposes the development of a comprehensive AI-driven framework that not only monitors operator physiological and behavioral parameters but also correlates them with machine dynamics and environmental conditions. The integration of multimodal data sources within a unified analytical model will enable predictive assessment of fatality risks and facilitate timely intervention before accidents occur.\n\n\n\n2. Proposed Methodology\n\nThe proposed system architecture comprises four major modules: **(i)** data acquisition, **(ii)** signal processing and feature extraction, **(iii)** AI-based risk assessment, and **(iv)** alert and intervention mechanisms. The data acquisition subsystem will capture multimodal inputs, including video feeds (facial expressions, eye movements, and posture), physiological signals (heart rate, galvanic skin response, and respiration rate), machine telemetry (speed, load, vibration), and environmental data (illumination, temperature, and gas concentration). Sensor fusion techniques will be implemented to synchronize heterogeneous data streams and mitigate noise or redundancy. Feature extraction will involve time\u2013frequency analysis, image-based emotion detection, and motion pattern recognition using computer vision algorithms. The risk assessment module will employ hybrid AI models combining CNNs for spatial feature learning and LSTMs for temporal pattern analysis to evaluate operator fatigue, stress, and hazard probability. A Bayesian inference layer will integrate contextual parameters to compute a real-time fatality risk index. The system will further incorporate reinforcement learning algorithms to adaptively refine risk prediction thresholds based on operational feedback. The final module will trigger graduated alerts through audio-visual cues or, in extreme conditions, initiate autonomous machine deceleration or shutdown protocols. Prototype validation will be conducted under simulated mining environments using instrumented HEMM units to evaluate system reliability, response latency, and predictive accuracy.\n\n\n\n3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion\n\nThe primary outcome of this research will be the development of a fully functional **AI-based fatality risk detection system** tailored for HEMM operations. The system is expected to achieve real-time monitoring and prediction of hazardous operator states with an accuracy exceeding 90%, enabling proactive accident prevention. Quantitatively, it is anticipated to reduce human-factor-related incidents by up to 40% and significantly lower downtime associated with safety interventions. The project will deliver a modular prototype incorporating hardware (sensors and embedded controllers), software (AI models and decision algorithms), and user interfaces for on-site deployment. Furthermore, the research will generate a comprehensive dataset of operator behavior and machine interaction patterns in mining environments, contributing valuable knowledge to occupational safety analytics. From a scientific perspective, the project advances the application of deep learning, multimodal data fusion, and human\u2013machine interaction in high-risk industrial domains. The system\u2019s predictive and adaptive capabilities will represent a paradigm shift from reactive safety measures to intelligent, preventive risk management.

        "full_text": "Abstract\n\nThe proposed research focuses on the **development of an economically viable technology for the reclamation of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)** in the North Eastern (NE) coalfields, where extensive mining activities have resulted in severe environmental degradation due to the oxidation of sulfide minerals. AMD, characterized by low pH and elevated concentrations of iron, manganese, and sulfate, poses a major threat to aquatic ecosystems, soil fertility, and regional water quality. Current remediation techniques\u2014such as lime neutralization, constructed wetlands, and passive bioreactors\u2014often suffer from high operational costs and limited adaptability to the complex geochemical and hydrological conditions prevalent in NE India. This project proposes a novel hybrid reclamation system integrating **low-cost mineral adsorbents, biologically mediated sulfate reduction, and modular robotic process control** to enable sustainable, field-deployable AMD treatment. The research will involve geochemical characterization of AMD sources, optimization of treatment parameters, and development of an autonomous monitoring unit for continuous operation. Emphasis will be placed on material reusability, byproduct recovery, and energy efficiency to ensure economic feasibility. The expected outcome is a scalable reclamation technology that mitigates AMD impacts while supporting resource circularity and environmental compliance in mining operations, aligning with the principles of green mining and sustainable mineral resource management.\n\n\n\n1. Introduction & Background\n\nThe North Eastern coalfields of India, particularly in Assam and Meghalaya, are characterized by extensive deposits of high-sulfur sub-bituminous and tertiary coals. Uncontrolled mining and exposure of pyritic formations have led to persistent **Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)**, a phenomenon arising from the oxidation of sulfide minerals (mainly pyrite, FeS\u2082) in the presence of oxygen and water, producing sulfuric acid and dissolved metal ions. The resulting acidic effluents significantly lower the pH of receiving streams, mobilize heavy metals, and degrade local ecosystems. Traditional remediation approaches such as lime neutralization, active aeration, and settling ponds provide partial treatment but entail substantial chemical and maintenance costs, making them unsuitable for remote and economically constrained mining regions. Moreover, the unique climatic and geological conditions of the NE coalfields\u2014marked by high rainfall, steep terrain, and dispersed mining sites\u2014demand adaptive, low-maintenance, and modular treatment technologies. Recent advances in **biogeochemical engineering** and **autonomous process control** offer promising pathways to address these challenges. By integrating biological sulfate-reducing processes with engineered adsorbent systems and automated control architectures, it is possible to develop an economically sustainable and environmentally resilient solution for AMD mitigation. This project thus seeks to bridge the gap between laboratory-scale remediation techniques and field-scale deployment, ensuring the long-term ecological recovery of the NE coalfield region.\n\n\n\n2. Proposed Methodology\n\nThe proposed R&D project will employ an integrated, multi-phase approach encompassing **site characterization, process development, system integration, and pilot-scale validation**. Initially, comprehensive sampling and geochemical analysis of AMD sources will be conducted to determine acidity, sulfate concentration, metal load, and microbial community structure. Based on this data, a hybrid treatment model will be designed combining three primary components: **(i)** mineral-based adsorption using locally available lateritic or clay minerals for metal sequestration, **(ii)** biologically driven sulfate reduction using mixed microbial consortia in an anaerobic bioreactor, and **(iii)** automated process regulation utilizing low-cost robotic sensors and feedback control algorithms to maintain optimal redox and pH conditions. The reactor design will incorporate modular treatment cells allowing scalability and ease of maintenance. The system will operate in semi-passive mode to minimize energy requirements, with effluent recycling for enhanced retention time. Advanced characterization techniques such as ICP-OES, XRD, and SEM-EDS will be employed to evaluate metal removal efficiency and material stability. Economic modeling and life-cycle assessment will be integrated to quantify cost-benefit ratios and environmental impact. Finally, a pilot-scale demonstration unit will be installed at a representative AMD-affected site in the NE coalfields to evaluate field performance, reliability, and long-term sustainability under variable climatic conditions.\n\n\n\nExpected Outcomes & Conclusion\n\nThe expected outcome of the project is the development of a **cost-effective, sustainable, and field-deployable reclamation technology** for the treatment of Acid Mine Drainage in the NE coalfields. The integrated system is anticipated to achieve pH neutralization within the range of 6.5\u20138.0, with more than 90% removal efficiency for key heavy metals such as Fe, Mn, and Al, while maintaining low operational and maintenance costs. The inclusion of biologically mediated sulfate reduction will minimize reagent consumption, whereas the use of indigenous mineral adsorbents will ensure economic feasibility and local material utilization. The autonomous robotic control subsystem will enable continuous, real-time monitoring and adaptive regulation of process parameters, reducing dependency on skilled labor in remote locations. In addition to environmental restoration, the process may facilitate recovery of secondary resources such as metal precipitates, potentially adding economic value. The technology will serve as a model for **green mining practices** in India, contributing to compliance with environmental regulations and improving the socio-ecological resilience of mining communities.

        "full_text": "Abstract\n\nThe proposed research focuses on the development of a data-driven, machine learning-based framework for real-time monitoring of strata stability in underground and open-pit mining environments. Strata instability poses one of the most critical geotechnical hazards in mining operations, often leading to roof falls, rock bursts, and ground subsidence, which compromise both safety and productivity. Traditional monitoring approaches, relying on periodic manual inspections or localized sensor measurements, are limited by data sparsity, latency, and an inability to capture complex nonlinear interactions among geological, mechanical, and environmental factors. This project proposes an intelligent, integrated framework that leverages high-frequency sensor data, Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, and advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and classify strata stability conditions in real time.

Introduction & Background\n\nStrata stability monitoring is a cornerstone of ground control management in mining engineering, ensuring operational safety, structural integrity, and sustainable resource extraction. Instabilities in mine strata result from complex interactions between in situ stresses, excavation geometry, groundwater conditions, and time-dependent deformation behaviors. Conventional monitoring methods\u2014such as manual visual inspections, borehole extensometry, or periodic instrumentation\u2014provide discrete and localized data, which are often insufficient for predictive assessment. The lack of continuous, integrated data interpretation has historically limited the capability to forecast potential failures before catastrophic events occur. With the emergence of digital sensors, wireless communication, and big data analytics, there is a growing potential to transform traditional monitoring into intelligent, real-time predictive systems. Data-driven approaches, particularly machine learning and deep learning models, enable the analysis of large-scale, multivariate time-series datasets to identify patterns that precede instability. Furthermore, IoT-enabled sensor networks allow for continuous, high-resolution data acquisition from distributed monitoring nodes. Despite these technological advances, existing systems often fail to incorporate automated learning and adaptive risk prediction models suited to dynamic mine environments. Therefore, this research proposes a comprehensive data-driven framework that integrates sensor fusion, advanced ML algorithms, and real-time analytics for continuous strata stability assessment and early warning generation, thereby bridging the gap between monitoring, prediction, and actionable decision-making in mining operations.\n\n2. Proposed Methodology\n\nThe proposed research will adopt a multi-tiered methodological framework encompassing data acquisition, feature engineering, model development, and system integration. Initially, an IoT-based monitoring network will be established, integrating heterogeneous sensors such as displacement transducers, acoustic emission detectors, microseismic sensors, and stress gauges. These devices will transmit high-frequency data to an edge-computing unit for preprocessing, including noise filtering, normalization, and data synchronization. A data warehouse will be developed using time-series databases to handle large volumes of streaming data. Advanced feature extraction techniques\u2014such as wavelet transforms, statistical descriptors, and fractal analysis\u2014will be employed to identify early indicators of strata deformation and stress redistribution. Machine learning models will then be trained on historical and real-time data to predict strata instability. Deep neural architectures, including CNNs for spatial data interpretation and LSTM networks for temporal dependency modeling, will be optimized through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Ensemble learning and transfer learning techniques will further enhance model robustness and adaptability to varying geological conditions. A real-time risk evaluation engine will be developed to translate predictive outputs into actionable stability indices. Finally, a web-based visualization dashboard will be implemented, integrating automated alerts, 3D geospatial mapping, and decision-support analytics. Field validation will be conducted in collaboration with operating mines to evaluate predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and long-term reliability under real-world conditions.\n\n3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this research is the development of a real-time, data-driven machine learning framework for strata stability assessment that surpasses the limitations of conventional monitoring techniques. The system is expected to achieve early detection of instability events with high precision, enabling proactive interventions and reducing the likelihood of roof or wall collapses.

Coal washeries generate large quantities of rejects containing substantial amounts of fine coking coal that remain unrecovered due to the inefficiencies of conventional beneficiation methods. These rejects not only represent a significant loss of valuable carbonaceous material but also contribute to environmental degradation through large-scale disposal in slurry ponds and dumps. The proposed study will focus on the design and optimization of a hybrid physical\u2013chemical beneficiation process integrating advanced froth flotation, enhanced gravity separation, and surface chemistry modification.

The project aligns with the strategic objectives of sustainable mining and resource conservation, contributing significantly to India\u2019s metallurgical coal security and reducing the ecological footprint of coal washing operations.\n\n1. Introduction & Background\n\nCoking coal is a critical input for steelmaking, and its demand continues to rise with industrial growth and infrastructure development. However, India\u2019s coking coal reserves are limited and often characterized by high ash content, necessitating beneficiation prior to metallurgical use. During coal washing operations, significant quantities of fine coal particles are lost in washery rejects, which typically contain 25\u201340% combustible matter. These rejects are usually disposed of in tailings ponds or dumps, creating severe environmental hazards such as spontaneous combustion, acid mine drainage, and land degradation. Conventional recovery processes like froth flotation and spiral concentrators are limited by inefficient fine particle separation, poor selectivity, and high reagent consumption. Recent advancements in fine coal beneficiation\u2014including the use of enhanced gravity separators, column flotation, and chemical surface modification\u2014have shown potential for improving recovery from ultra-fine fractions. Nevertheless, these technologies require adaptation to Indian coal characteristics, which are known for high clay content and complex mineralogical associations. This project seeks to develop an integrated technological framework that leverages advanced separation science, process automation, and machine learning-based optimization for efficient recovery of coking coal from washery rejects. The outcome will address both economic and environmental imperatives by transforming waste into a valuable secondary resource and promoting sustainable coal processing practices.\n\n2. Proposed Methodology\n\nThe proposed R&D work will follow a multi-phase approach involving characterization, process development, optimization, and pilot-scale validation. Initially, representative washery reject samples will be collected from major Indian coking coal washeries. Comprehensive characterization will be conducted using proximate and ultimate analyses, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS), and float-sink studies to understand mineralogical associations and liberation characteristics. Based on the results, a process flow sheet will be designed integrating selective comminution, advanced froth flotation, and enhanced gravity separation techniques such as the Falcon concentrator or Knelson separator. Surface modification using surfactants and polymeric reagents will be explored to improve hydrophobic\u2013hydrophilic selectivity for fine particle recovery. A data-driven optimization framework employing machine learning algorithms\u2014such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and genetic algorithms\u2014will be used to identify optimal operating parameters including reagent dosage, particle size distribution, and hydrodynamic conditions. The process performance will be evaluated in terms of recovery yield, ash reduction, and energy consumption. A techno-economic analysis will be carried out to assess scalability and cost-effectiveness. The final stage will involve pilot-scale implementation using a semi-continuous beneficiation unit integrated with automated process monitoring and control systems to validate the developed technology under real washery operating conditions.\n\n3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion\n\nThe proposed project is expected to result in the development of an optimized, scalable, and eco-efficient technology for the recovery of coking coal from washery rejects. The integrated beneficiation process is projected to achieve a combustible recovery exceeding 70% with a reduction of ash content to below 17%, making the recovered product suitable for metallurgical applications. The technology will offer significant environmental benefits by reducing the volume of washery rejects requiring disposal, thus mitigating associated land and water pollution. The incorporation of surface chemistry modification and data-driven optimization will enhance process adaptability across different coal types and washery configurations. From an industrial perspective, the developed system will improve resource utilization efficiency and contribute to the self-reliance of the steel sector by augmenting domestic coking coal supplies.

Failures in these structures often result from complex interactions between geological discontinuities, water infiltration, blasting vibrations, and progressive deformation. Traditional stability monitoring methods\u2014such as total station surveys, borehole inclinometers, and visual inspections\u2014are spatially limited, labor-intensive, and lack the temporal resolution required for real-time hazard detection. Recent advancements in robotics, remote sensing, and geotechnical instrumentation have introduced new possibilities for autonomous, data-driven slope monitoring systems. UAVs equipped with high-resolution cameras and LiDAR sensors can generate detailed 3D surface models, enabling precise detection of micro-topographic changes over time. Concurrently, ground-based sensors can continuously record geotechnical parameters, providing complementary subsurface information. Integrating these multi-source datasets using artificial intelligence and geospatial analytics allows for early detection of instability mechanisms and predictive modeling of potential failure zones. Despite such technological potential, existing systems lack full automation, sensor fusion capabilities, and field adaptability under variable mining conditions. This project addresses these limitations by developing a comprehensive drone-sensor hybrid framework for continuous monitoring and predictive assessment of slope and dump stability, advancing current geotechnical monitoring practices toward intelligent and autonomous hazard management systems.\n\n2. Proposed Methodology\n\nThe project methodology is structured into four major phases: (i) data acquisition and instrumentation, (ii) data integration and modeling, (iii) predictive analysis and visualization, and (iv) field validation and system optimization.\nIn the first phase, UAVs equipped with LiDAR, RGB, and multispectral cameras will be deployed to capture high-resolution imagery and topographic point clouds over slope and dump areas. Simultaneously, ground-based geotechnical sensors\u2014such as inclinometers, extensometers, piezometers, and ground vibration sensors\u2014will be installed to record deformation, pore pressure, and dynamic response data. In the second phase, the acquired datasets will be spatially registered within a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework, and a digital elevation model (DEM) will be generated to detect temporal surface changes through differential analysis. Machine learning algorithms, including random forest classifiers and deep neural networks, will be developed to identify instability precursors by correlating sensor data with geospatial deformation patterns. Predictive models will be trained using historical failure data and continuously updated through adaptive learning mechanisms. The third phase will focus on integrating predictive outputs into an automated visualization and alerting dashboard using web-based interfaces. Finally, pilot testing will be conducted at an operational mine site to validate model accuracy, sensor performance, and communication reliability, with optimization focusing on energy efficiency, data latency reduction, and system robustness under field conditions.\n\n3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this research is a fully integrated, drone- and sensor-based system for real-time monitoring and prediction of slope and dump stability in surface mining environments. The system will deliver multi-dimensional insights by combining aerial photogrammetry, LiDAR mapping, and in-situ geotechnical data into a unified decision-support framework. It is expected to achieve high spatial resolution (centimeter-scale) and temporal continuity (sub-hourly updates), enabling early detection of deformation trends and identification of potential failure zones. The machine learning algorithms will enhance prediction accuracy, reducing false alarms and allowing for reliable early warning generation. Quantitatively, the developed system aims to improve slope stability assessment accuracy by 25\u201330% compared to conventional methods. The technology will contribute to improved mine safety, reduced operational downtime, and more efficient waste dump management. Furthermore, it will promote the implementation of autonomous monitoring practices in line with the principles of Mining 4.0, fostering a shift from reactive to proactive geotechnical risk management. In conclusion, the project represents a significant advancement toward intelligent, data-driven mine safety management, providing a scalable and replicable model for deployment across diverse geotechnical and mining environments worldwide."

The expected outcome is a scalable, economically viable treatment process that achieves high metal removal efficiency while minimizing secondary waste generation, contributing to sustainable water management and environmental compliance in mining regions.\n\n1. Introduction & Background\n\nAcid mine drainage is a critical environmental problem arising from the exposure of sulfide-rich mineral deposits to oxygen and water during mining activities. The resulting acidic effluent typically contains high concentrations of toxic heavy metals, which are highly soluble under low pH conditions and can contaminate surface and groundwater systems, negatively impacting aquatic ecosystems and human health. Traditional AMD treatment methods, including lime addition, neutralization ponds, and passive wetland systems, often involve significant chemical consumption, generate large volumes of metal-laden sludge, and are inadequate for achieving stringent regulatory limits for trace metals. Moreover, the heterogeneous composition of AMD, fluctuating flow rates, and variability in metal concentrations pose additional challenges to consistent treatment. Recent advances in adsorption-based technologies, using low-cost and high-surface-area materials, offer promising pathways for selective heavy metal removal. Biochar, industrial residues, and modified mineral adsorbents have demonstrated high affinity for toxic metals under acidic conditions, while synergistic integration with chemical precipitation and microbial remediation can enhance overall treatment efficiency. This project seeks to develop an integrated, cost-effective treatment process for AMD, combining adsorption, chemical, and biological methods to achieve comprehensive metal removal. The research will address key knowledge gaps related to adsorbent selection, process optimization, and scalability, providing a sustainable solution for the reclamation of AMD-impacted water resources in mining regions.\n\n2.

Initially, representative AMD samples will be collected from diverse mining sites and analyzed for pH, redox potential, metal speciation, ionic strength, and organic/inorganic constituents using ICP-OES, AAS, and XRD techniques. The first treatment module will focus on adsorption-based metal removal, employing biochar, zeolites, and industrial by-products as adsorbents. Adsorbent surface modification using functional groups or nanoparticle impregnation will be explored to enhance selectivity and capacity. Batch and column studies will optimize key parameters including contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH adjustment, and temperature. The second module will integrate chemical precipitation and co-precipitation using cost-effective reagents such as lime or sodium hydroxide, aiming to target residual metals and enhance sludge dewaterability. Where feasible, microbial-assisted remediation using metal-tolerant sulfate-reducing bacteria will be employed to facilitate biogenic sulfide precipitation. A modular process flow sheet will be developed and simulated using mass and energy balances to predict system performance and optimize operational efficiency. Finally, a pilot-scale demonstration unit will be constructed to evaluate real-time metal removal efficiency, effluent quality, operational costs, and sludge generation under continuous flow conditions, ensuring the scalability and economic viability of the proposed treatment process.\n\n3. Expected Outcomes & Conclusion\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this research include the development of a robust, efficient, and economically sustainable AMD treatment process capable of removing a broad spectrum of toxic heavy metals to meet or exceed environmental regulatory standards. The integrated adsorption\u2013chemical\u2013biological system is expected to achieve metal removal efficiencies exceeding 90% for major toxic ions such as Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Pb, while minimizing sludge production and chemical consumption.
